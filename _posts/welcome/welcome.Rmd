Reading this [article](https://blog.r-hub.io/2020/04/29/maintenance/), I thought 
I might revisit my attempt at a personal website. 

This includes switching from [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) to
[distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) (mainly just for a change) and 
also trying github actions rather than travis (partly because I've been using 
Azure DevOps pipeline builds at work).

For now this is a work-in-progress, with this post part of the setup testing.
